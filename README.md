## ⚔️ The Battlefield

There was once a valley, unnamed by any cartographer, shaped like a wound torn through the hills. Here, men clashed like thunder in the summer heat. Steel met steel. Orders flew like arrows through smoke. Dust rose so thick, it painted the sky with sorrow.

The fields were scorched by cannon-fire, trampled by boots driven by duty, and soaked in the cries of those who charged forward not knowing if they'd return.

*The air itself seemed to scream.*

## 🌅 The Sunset: Amber Over Ash

And then, it comes.

The sun, now low and golden, cuts through the haze. Its light falls across the broken blades, the bloodied helms, the fractured ground—and turns it beautiful.

Amber streaks burn through the clouds like redemption. Shadows lengthen. The sky becomes a painting, and for the first time, no one raises their hand to shield their eyes.

They watch.

Soldiers—torn, tired, trembling—sit down. Some lean on each other. Some sit alone. But all turn their faces toward the horizon where **ash meets amber**, and for a fleeting moment, they forget the battle. They are not warriors anymore.

They are witnesses.

## 🛌 The Rest

Some sleep, right there in the field, armor still clinging to them like memories. Others hum lullabies they haven’t sung since youth. The wind carries the scent of fire and flowers—burned earth and new beginnings.

No one tells them where to go. There is no need.

In this place of ash and amber, they rest. And the world, as if in apology, lets them.
